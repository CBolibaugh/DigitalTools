# Methods
We report how we determined our sample size, all data exclusions (if any), all manipulations, and all measures in the study. <!-- 21-word solution (Simmons, Nelson & Simonsohn, 2012; retrieved from http://ssrn.com/abstract=2160588) -->

## Material

## Procedure

## Data analysis
We used `r cite_r("r-references.bib")` for all our analyses.


# Results
```{r ind-vars, echo = FALSE}
#simulate normally distributed data for an independent samples t-test
muA <- 50 #what's the population mean for condition A?
muB <- 55 #what's the population mean for condition B?

n1 <- 100 #how many participants group A?
n2 <- 100 #how many participants group B?

sigma1 <- 20 #population standard deviation of condition A?
sigma2 <- 20 #population standard deviation of condition B?
```
```{r ind-dat, echo=FALSE}
A_scores <- rnorm(n1,muA,sigma1) #simulate a vector of 100 deviates from normal distribution
B_scores <- rnorm(n2,muB,sigma2) #simulate a vector of 100 deviates from normal distribution
```


Participants from Condition A scored an average of `r printnum(mean(A_scores))` points, with a *SD* of `r printnum(sd(A_scores))`, while participants from Condition B scored an average of `r printnum(mean(B_scores))` points, with a *SD* of `r printnum(sd(B_scores))`.

The distribution of scores can be seen in 
```{r histA, fig.cap = "Figure 1: Distribution of scores from Group A", echo=FALSE}
hist(A_scores)
```

```{r histB, fig.cap = "Figure 2: Distribution of scores from Group B", echo = FALSE}
hist(B_scores)
```
