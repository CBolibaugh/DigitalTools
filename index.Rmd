title: "Digital Tools for Reproducible Research"

Here you will find the materials associated with *Digital Tools for Reproducible Research: A reproducible project from start to finish*, in the [Department of Education, University of York](https://www.york.ac.uk/education/).

Materials and a demo OSF site for the project can additionally be found [here](https://osf.io/jrxyw/).

This series of 5 brownbags provides a practical introduction to digital tools needed to complete a reproducible research project. Each session will move through a successive stage of a project, with a focus on tangible outputs (e.g. OSF project page, preregistration, analysis script and power analysis, reproducible manuscript template).

The brownbags are aimed at researchers (staff and PhD) who already have a reasonable grounding in data analysis and experimental/study design. Some sessions (e.g. data simulation) will be focused on quantitative analyses. Knowledge of the R statistical programming language is not assumed, and while scripts will be provided to get started in appropriate sessions, the sessions are not a complete introduction to R.

You might want to take the opportunity to work on a planned empirical study; if so you will finish the sessions with a completed preregistration which includes analysis scripts and power estimates, as well as the template for the manuscript. If you don't have a planned study, the sessions can be scaled by focusing on a replication of a published paper.

*You will need to bring your own laptop in order to fully participate.*

**Sessions:**

-   Week 5 [Reproducible research](./Week5.html)\
-   Week 6 [Preregistration](./Week6.html)\
-   Week 8 [Open data](./Week8.html)\
-   Week 9 [Reproducible analyses, power analysis and simulation](./Week9.html)\
-   Week 10 [Writing a reproducible manuscript](./Week10.html)
