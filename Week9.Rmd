Materials for Session 4 in Week 9: slides can be found [here](./04DigitalTools.pdf), and Rmd file can be found [here](./simsWeek9.html).

➔	What is a reproducible analysis (& power analysis)? 

➔	Draft a reproducible analysis script for your project (practical)
◆	Script a simple analysis in R & upload analysis script to OSF

➔	Draft a script for power analysis based on a given effect size for your project using simulation methods (practical)  
◆	Identify “smallest effect size of interest” (SESOI) for your study’s focal test 
◆	Write a function to iterate data simulation for SESOI and analysis, saving the output each time. 
◆	Run analysis with different samples sizes
◆	Print power estimate for different sample sizes. 

FOLLOW-UP: Update preregistration document with new SESOI & power analysis
